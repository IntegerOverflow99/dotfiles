# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for \*nix systems.

## Dependencies

- `ly`
- `hyprland`
- `waybar`
- `rofi`
- `kitty`
- `fastfetch`

Install them all quick in an arch-based system with:

```bash
sudo pacman -S ly hyprland waybar rofi kitty fastfetch
```

## Installing the Dotfiles

Convenience script to install `install.sh` will backup existing dotfiles and create symlinks to the ones in this repo. It must be run from inside this repo. You can manually move files where they need to go if you prefer.
